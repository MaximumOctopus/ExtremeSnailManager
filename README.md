# Extreme Snail Manager
Snail Racing Manager, simulation/strategy game. EXTREME! To the max!

Manage a team of snails across the world. Action-packed and full of adventure.

The game itself likely won't be open source, but I'm going to open up all of the tools to allow for maximum user customisation!

Started in the mid-nineties as a silly DOS game. Restarted in 2019. Restarted again in 2022. But this time I'm going to finish it. Then restarted again in 2024. I'm really going to finish it this time. 

Lots to do, don't expect any (useful) code until late 2024, early 2025. 

The game itself won't be available until later 2025/early 2026. If you want to beta test it then please let me know.
